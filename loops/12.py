#For your A
# Let's filter out the letter 'A' from our string.
#
# Do the following for each character in the phrase.
# If char is an 'A' or char is an 'a', print 'X', instead of char. Make sure to include the trailing comma.
# Otherwise (else:), please print char, with the trailing comma.
# phrase = "A bird in the hand..."

# Add your for loop
for char in phrase:
    if char == "A" or char == "a":
        print 'X',
    else:
        print char,
#Don't delete this print statement!
print
